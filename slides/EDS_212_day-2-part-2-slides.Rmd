$$\frac{df}{dx}=\lim_{\Delta x\to 0}\frac{f(x+\Delta x)-f(x)}{\Delta x}$$

## Derivative of logs & exponents

- $\frac{d}{dx}(e^x) = e^x$

- $\frac{d}{dx}ln(x)=\frac{1}{x}$

---

## Derivatives in R with `D()`

### Example: 

```{r}
# Create and store your function
fx <- expression(x^2)

# Find the derivative (with `D()` function):
df_dx <- D(fx, 'x')

# Find the slope at x = 10:
x <- 10
eval(df_dx)
```

---

### You try! 

Using the `D()` function in R:

1. Find $\frac{dg}{dx}$ given: $g(z) = 2z^3-10.5z^2+4.1$

2. Find $\frac{dT}{dy}$ given: $T(y) = (2y^3+1)^4-8y^3$

---

### Solutions: 

$g(z) = 2z^3-10.5z^2+4.1$

```{r}
  gz = expression(2*z^3 - 10.5*z^2 + 4.1)
  dg_dz = D(gz, 'z')
```

</br>

$T(y) = (2y^3+1)^4-8y^3$

```{r}
  ty = expression((2*y^3+1)^4 - 8*y^3)
  dt_dy = D(ty, 'y')
```

---

## To find the slope of T(y) at a range of y-values:

```{r}

# Create a sequence of y values from -0.4 to 2.0, by increments of 0.1
y <- seq(-0.4, 2.0, by = 0.1)

# Evaluate the slope of T(y) at each of those values
eval(dt_dy)
```

---

## Applications 

- Minimum & maximum values (slope = 0)

- Increasing & decreasing functions (bounded by critical points)

- Describing rates of change is common in environmental science
