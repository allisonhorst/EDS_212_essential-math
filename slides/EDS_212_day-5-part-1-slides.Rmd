## Basic probability theory 

---

## Why?

- Hypothesis testing
- Bayesian statistics
- Decision making

---

class: center, middle

## The Monty Hall Problem
![](slide_images/monty_hall.jpg)

---

Terms: Event, event space, probability, law of large numbers

---

## Basic probability theory and notation

- Union

- Intersection

- Complement

---

For discrete variables

---

For continuous variables

---

Probability of an exact value for a continuous variable

---

Conditional probability

--- 

A Bayes example

---

## Intuition check 

The following are jitterplots (overlaying violin plots) of flipper length for Ad√©lie, chinstrap and gentoo penguins recorded by Dr. Kristen Gorman at islands in Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica. 

We'll consider: given some mystery penguins with different flipper lengths, how might the length inform which species we think it is? 

---

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(palmerpenguins)
library(tidyverse)

ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = species, y = flipper_length_mm)) +
  geom_violin(fill = "gray90", color = NA) +
  geom_jitter(size = 0.2, width = 0.05) +
  theme_minimal() +
  coord_flip()
```

## Terms

**Population:** The entire collection of things in a category you are trying to understand. **You define the population.** For example: Santa Barbara registered voters, Ponderosa pines in Inyo National Forest, purple urchins in Channel Islands Marine Sanctuary. 

**Sample:** A subset of the population, goal is to be *representative* of the population

**Parameter:** A characteristic of the population

**Statistic:** A characteristic of the sample

---

## Inference

Usually, we don't have the resources (time, money, humanpower, etc.) to collect observations for an entire population. As a proxy, we try to collect a representative sample. 

Then, we attempt to draw conclusions about the **populations** from which our samples were collected.

---

## Probability density function

---

## One example: 2-sample t-test

**Note:** You will cover this in depth in EDS 222. We'll just build some intuition here for what basic hypothesis tests do, and how probability is involved.
