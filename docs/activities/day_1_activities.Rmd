## Section 1. Back-of-the-envelope (small groups)

For this group task section, work in small groups of 4 - 5 to do back-of-the-envelope calculations. You'll work together to make an estimate for the value.

You'll spend \~15 minutes with your group discussing, clarifying your assumptions, doing your back-of-the envelope calculations, and coming up with an estimate. Then, a spokesperson for your group will report back on your thought process, assumptions & conclusion.

**The only rule: you can't use the internet.**

**You are absolutely allowed to poll your peers (even from other groups).**

#### Credit: all examples here are from, carefully considered in, [what-if.xkcd.com](what-if.xkcd.com)

-   **Group A:** When electrofishing, usually 100 $\mu W$ per cm^3^ (of fish volume) is sufficient to temporarily stop a fish heart. How much energy would you need to electro"fish" for a blue whale?
-   **Group B:** What is the fastest you could visit all 50 states by car?
-   **Group C:** If a T-rex were released in New York City, how many humans/day would it need to consume to get its needed calorie intake?
-   **Group D:** If you dropped a 13 pound bowling ball off the side of a boat over the Marianas Trench, how long would it take to reach the bottom?
-   **Group E:** If the world was scaled to the size of a basketball, what would the height of Mt. Everest be?
-   **Group F:** If there was zip line from the moon to the earth, assuming no issues with rotation, atmosphere, etc., how long would it take to zip line between them?

## Section 2. Practice problems

### Evaluate the following:

1.  By hand: Evaluate $f(x,y)=x^2-1+3xy$ at $x=1$ and $y = 0$

2.  In the R Console: given $G(t,z)=3.1(t-4.2)^2 + 0.06z$, find the value of $G(1, 2.5)$ (you do NOT need to write a function - just do the calculation in R using R as a calculator)

### Units:

3.  You are combining information from multiple sources to estimate the total annual oil spilled in a watershed, reported by different companies. The following are reported for the year:

-   Company A: 14.6 barrels spilled (with 9.3 barrels recovered)
-   Company B: 692 liters spilled (94% recovered)
-   Company C: 18.1 gallons spilled (0% recovered)

What is the total *unrecovered* amount of oil spilled into the watershed that year, in barrels. Use R & Google here for calculations. 

### Average slope

4. By hand: If an urchin population in a study plot in 1990 is 432, and in 2004 is 801, what is the average rate of population increase? Find the slope, then write a statement about the average increase (including units).

## Section 3: Projects and functions

-   Create a new Quarto project (named `eds-212-day-1`)

-   Add a new Quarto document in the project

-   Press 'Render' (save this in your project as `fish-length-weight.qmd`)

-   Delete everything below the first code chunk

-   Attach the `tidyverse` package in the setup chunk

-   Play around with markdown cells in the Quarto doc. Try adding text with at least the following:

    -   Headers of varying size
    -   Italics
    -   Bold
    -   Superscripts / subscripts
    -   Bulletpoints
    -   An image (google how!)

-   Add a new code chunk (for R code)

-   Within the R code chunk, write a function to estimate fish standard weight, given parameters $a$, $b$, and fish length $L$ as inputs. "Standard weight" is how much we expect a fish to weigh, give the species and fish length, and the nonlinear relationship is given by:

$$W=aL^b$$ 

where L is total fish length (centimeters), W is the expected fish weight (grams), and a and b are species-dependent parameter values.

-   Test out your function to find the mass (g) for a 60 cm fish of the following species (parameter estimates from Peyton et al. (2016)): 

    - Milkfish: a = 0.0905, b = 2.52
    - Giant trevally: a = 0.0353, b = 3.05
    - Great barracuda: a = 0.0181, b = 3.27


Peyton, K. A., T. S. Sakihara, L. K. Nishiura, T. T. Shindo, T. E. Shimoda, S. Hau, A. Akiona, and K. Lorance. 2016. “Length–Weight Relationships for Common Juvenile Fishes and Prey Species in Hawaiian Estuaries.” Journal of Applied Ichthyology 32 (3): 499–502. https://doi.org/10.1111/jai.12957. 

- Make and store (as `fish_length`) sequence of size ranges from 0 to 200 cm, by increments of 1 cm

- Estimate the weight for giant barracudas along that entire range (given the parameters above). Store the output as `barracuda_weight`

- Bind the lengths and estimated barracuda weights into a single data frame using `data.frame()`

- Create a ggplot graph of predicted length versus weight for giant barracuda

- Update the graph axis labels and title

- Render the .qmd
