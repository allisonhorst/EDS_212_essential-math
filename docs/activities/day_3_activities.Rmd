## Part 1: By hand linear algebra fundamentals 

### Vector math

For the vectors $\vec a = (1,6)$ and $\vec b = (2, 4)$: 

- Find and sketch $\vec a + \vec b$
- Find and sketch $\vec b - \vec a$
- Find and sketch $4 \vec a$
- Find $\vec a \cdot \vec b$

### Matrix math

- Given the matrix:


## Part 2: Fork & clone a repo, use the code

- Fork and clone this repo, which contains an R Markdown document with code to numerically solve the SIR equations, to create a version-controlled R Project

- Once you've created your R Project, open the `sir-ode.Rmd` file. 

- Run all code in the .Rmd (Cmd + Option + R, or go up to the run button and choose the last option "Run All")

- Explore the code and output graph. What is the code doing? What is the graph telling us? 

- Make small changes to the parameter values to see how the SIR models change. Are the changes expected? 

- After trying out a few changes, save and knit your new output graph.

- Stage, commit, pull, then push to your repo.

- Check for your changes on GitHub. Are they there? Cool, done with Part 2.

## Part 3: Coding practice

- Create a new version-controlled R Project using the "GitHub repo *first*" workflow (hint: make a new repo on GitHub named `eds212-day3-part3` with a ReadMe, then clone to link to an R Project...)

- Create a new .Rmd within your project
