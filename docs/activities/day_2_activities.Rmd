## Section 1: Derivatives by hand

### First order univariate:

1. By hand using the definition of the derivative (i.e., "the long way"), find $\frac{dT}{dq}$ for $T(q)=2-3q^2$

2. By hand and using derivative rules: Find $\frac{df}{dx}$ for $f(x)=0.5x^4+2x-3$

3. By hand and using derivative rules: What is the slope (in the z-direction) for $G(z)=0.8-0.5z^2$ at $z = 4.7$?

### Higher order univariate: 

### Partial derivatives: 

## Section 2: Derivatives in R

- Create a new R Project (named `eds-212-day-2`)
- Create a new R Markdown document
- Knit (save as `derivatives-in-R.Rmd`)
- Use `usethis::use_git()` and `usethis::use_github()` to make your project a version-controlled repo, with an upstream GitHub repo

### First order univariate derivatives:

- In your R Markdown document, find the derivative expression and slope at the indicated value for each the following functions in R (each in a separate code chunk). Use the `deriv()` function (see `?deriv`) for examples.

  A) $f(x)=x^2$ at $x = 3$
  B) $P(a)=2(3a+2)^4-5$ at $a = 1.2$
  C) $g(t)=\frac{-4t}{(t^2+1)^3}$ at $t = 0$


- Knit, stage, commit, pull, then push your changes. 

### Higher order univariate derivatives: 

- Back in RStudio, add a code chunk in your Rmd in which you find the second derivative with respect to $z$ for $G(z)=4.6-1.9z^3$ (use the `D()` function here, and check your solution by hand).

## Section 3: Transfering to Python

It's critical to expect you can take what you've learned about derivatives (and how to find them in R) into other languages. We want to be versatile data scientists who **expect that we can figure out how to do the same thing across different languages.**
