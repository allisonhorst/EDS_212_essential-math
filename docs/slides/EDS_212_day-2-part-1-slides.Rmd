## And that's how we find derivatives

Evaluate the slope between two generic points on any function (separated by $\Delta x$) as $\Delta x$ becomes infinitely small. 

### Let's try one.

Find an expression that tells us the slope of the function $f(x)=x^2-18.2$ at any value of $x$. 

$$\frac{df}{dx}=\lim_{\Delta x\to 0}\frac{f(x+\Delta x)-f(x)}{\Delta x}$$

$$=\lim_{\Delta x\to 0}\frac{((x+\Delta x)^2-18.2)-(x^2-18.2)}{\Delta x}=\frac{x^2+2x\Delta x+(\Delta x)^2-18.2-x^2+18.2}{\Delta x}$$
$$= \lim_{\Delta x\to 0} \frac{2x\Delta x+(\Delta x)^2}{\Delta x} = \lim_{\Delta x\to 0} {2x+\Delta x} = 2x$$

### It's cool to do that a few times, **but it gets really tedious really fast.**

So we have some basic derivative shortcut rules to speed it up a bit:

- **Power rule:** $\frac{d}{dx}(x^n)=nx^{n-1}$

- **Constant rule:**  if $k$ is a constant, $\frac{d}{dx}(k)=0$

- **Constant multiple rule:** if $k$ is a constant, $\frac{d}{dx}(kx) = k\space$

- **Sum and difference rule:** $\frac{d}{dx}(f(x)\pm g(x))=\frac{d}{dx} f(x)\pm \frac{d}{dx}g(x)$

</br>

...Yeah there are more (quotient, product, chain, etc.) - but we're not doing them.

## Reminder of what we're doing mathematically:

### Finding the slope between two generic points on a function as the distance between them gets infinitely small. That will give us an expression for the **slope at any point on the original function**.

## Derivative of logs & exponents

- $\frac{d}{dx}(e^x) = e^x$

- $\frac{d}{dx}ln(x)=\frac{1}{x}$

## Derivatives in R with `D()`

### Example: 

```{r}
# Create and store your function
fx <- expression(x^2)

# Find the derivative (with `D()` function):
df_dx <- D(fx, 'x')

# Find the slope at x = 10:
x <- 10
eval(df_dx)
```

---

### You try! 

Using the `D()` function in R:

1. Find $\frac{dg}{dx}$ given: $g(z) = 2z^3-10.5z^2+4.1$

2. Find $\frac{dT}{dy}$ given: $T(y) = (2y^3+1)^4-8y^3$

---

### Solutions: 

$g(z) = 2z^3-10.5z^2+4.1$

```{r}
  gz = expression(2*z^3 - 10.5*z^2 + 4.1)
  dg_dz = D(gz, 'z')
```

</br>

$T(y) = (2y^3+1)^4-8y^3$

```{r}
  ty = expression((2*y^3+1)^4 - 8*y^3)
  dt_dy = D(ty, 'y')
```

---

## To find the slope of T(y) at a range of y-values:

```{r}

# Create a sequence of y values from -0.4 to 2.0, by increments of 0.1
y <- seq(-0.4, 2.0, by = 0.1)

# Evaluate the slope of T(y) at each of those values
eval(dt_dy)
```

---

## Applications 

- Minimum & maximum values (slope = 0)

- Increasing & decreasing functions (bounded by critical points)

- Describing rates of change is common in environmental science
