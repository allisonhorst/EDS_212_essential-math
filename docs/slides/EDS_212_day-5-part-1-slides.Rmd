## Probability

**Definition:** the likelihood that an event or outcome occurs. Typically, $P = 0$ indicates no chance of an event or outcome happening, $P=1$ indicates it happens with certainty.

---

## Terminology

**Event space:** The collection of all possible unique outcomes of an experiment or scenario. Also called the *sample space.*

**Event:** A possible outcome (or combination of outcomes). The probability of event $A$ occurring is written as $P\{ A \}$.

The probability is the long term relative frequency of an event occurring, given all outcomes of the event space.

---

## Law of large numbers

If you repeat an experiment independently a large number of times, the calculated statistic (e.g. mean, proportion 'true', etc.) will be close to the true (expected) parameter. 

**Example:** Proportion "heads" over a long run of coin flips, with a fair coin. 

Let's sketch what it might look like...

---

## Basic probability theory, notation, and diagrams

- **Intersection:** Probability that outcomes co-occur. In other words, these are **AND** probability statements.

- **Union:** Probability that *at least one* outcome in the event space happens (could be just one, or all). In other words, these are **OR** probability statements. 

- **Complement:**  Probability that an outcome or set of outcomes *does not* occur

---

# Intersection

**Notation:** $P\{A\cap B\}$

**In words:** The probability of A *and* B happening (where A and B are independent events)

**Calculation:** $P\{A\cap B\} = P\{A\}*P\{A\}$

---

## Union

**Notation:** $P\{A\cup B\}$

**In words:** The probability of A *or* B happening (i.e., at least A or B happens, or both).

**Calculation:** $P\{A\cup B\}=P\{A\}+P\{B\}-P\{A\cap B\}$

---

## Complement

**Notation:** $P\{A'\}$

**In words:** The probability of $A$ **NOT** happening

**Calculation:** $P\{A'\}=1-P\{A\}$

---

## Conditional probability

If events are not independent, one event having occurred can *change* the probability of another event occurring. For events $A$ and $B$, the probability of $B$ given that $A$ is know to occur is: 

$P\{B|A\}=\frac{P\{A \cap\ B\}}{P\{A\}}$

A common question: Why doesn't this just simplify to $P\{B\}$ if the intersection is $P\{A\}*P\{B\}$?

## Intuition check 

The following are jitterplots (overlaying violin plots) of flipper length for Ad√©lie, chinstrap and gentoo penguins recorded by Dr. Kristen Gorman at islands in Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica. 

We'll consider: given some mystery penguins with different flipper lengths, how might the length inform which species we think it is? 

---

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(palmerpenguins)
library(tidyverse)

ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = species, y = flipper_length_mm)) +
  geom_violin(fill = "gray90", color = NA) +
  geom_jitter(size = 0.2, width = 0.05) +
  theme_minimal() +
  coord_flip()
```

---

## Terms

**Population:** The entire collection of things in a category you are trying to understand. **You define the population.** For example: Santa Barbara registered voters, Ponderosa pines in Inyo National Forest, purple urchins in Channel Islands Marine Sanctuary. 

**Sample:** A subset of the population, goal is to be *representative* of the population

**Parameter:** A characteristic of the population

**Statistic:** A characteristic of the sample

---

## Inference

Usually, we don't have the resources (time, money, humanpower, etc.) to collect observations for an entire population. As a proxy, we try to collect a representative sample. 

Then, we attempt to draw conclusions about the **populations** from which our samples were collected.

---

## Probability density function

On Day 4, we visualized data distributions from histograms. If we use histograms to estimate continuous functions that describe all possible outcomes, we have created a probability density function.

The area under any probability density function = 1, indicating that 100% of all possible outcomes are represented by the function. 

Drawing fun! 

---

## This gives us a basis for hypothesis testing (EDS 222)

If a null hypothesis is true, what is the probability that your data outcome (e.g. mean, value, etc.) or something more extreme would have occurred by random chance? 

Is that *so* unlikely (is the probability low enough), that you think you have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis? Or not? 

Let's brainstorm some examples (and to be continued...)
