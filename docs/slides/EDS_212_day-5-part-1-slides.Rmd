## Probability

**Definition:** the likelihood that an event or outcome occurs. Typically, $P = 0$ indicates no chance of an event or outcome happening, $P=1$ indicates it happens with certainty.

---

## Terminology

**Event space:** The collection of all possible unique outcomes of an experiment or scenario. Also called the *sample space.*

**Event:** A possible outcome (or combination of outcomes). The probability of event $A$ occurring is written as $P\{ A \}$.

The probability is the long term relative frequency of an event occurring, given all outcomes of the event space.

---

## Law of large numbers

If you repeat an experiment independently a large number of times, the calculated statistic (e.g. mean, proportion 'true', etc.) will be close to the true (expected) parameter. 

**Example:** Proportion "heads" over a long run of coin flips, with a fair coin. 

Let's sketch what it might look like...

## Intuition check 

The following are jitterplots (overlaying violin plots) of flipper length for Ad√©lie, chinstrap and gentoo penguins recorded by Dr. Kristen Gorman at islands in Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica. 

We'll consider: given some mystery penguins with different flipper lengths, how might the length inform which species we think it is? 

---

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(palmerpenguins)
library(tidyverse)

ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = species, y = flipper_length_mm)) +
  geom_violin(fill = "gray90", color = NA) +
  geom_jitter(size = 0.2, width = 0.05) +
  theme_minimal() +
  coord_flip()
```

## Terms

**Population:** The entire collection of things in a category you are trying to understand. **You define the population.** For example: Santa Barbara registered voters, Ponderosa pines in Inyo National Forest, purple urchins in Channel Islands Marine Sanctuary. 

**Sample:** A subset of the population, goal is to be *representative* of the population

**Parameter:** A characteristic of the population

**Statistic:** A characteristic of the sample

---

## Inference

Usually, we don't have the resources (time, money, humanpower, etc.) to collect observations for an entire population. As a proxy, we try to collect a representative sample. 

Then, we attempt to draw conclusions about the **populations** from which our samples were collected.

## Probability density function

## One example: 2-sample t-test

**Note:** You will cover this in depth in EDS 222. We'll just build some intuition here for what basic hypothesis tests do, and how probability is involved.
