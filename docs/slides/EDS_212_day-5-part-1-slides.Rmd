## Basic probability theory 

---

## Why?

- Hypothesis testing
- Bayesian statistics

---

## Intuition check (what type of penguin do you think this is?)

---

Population, sample, statistic, parameter

---

- We make assumptions about population distributions from samples
- From the assumed distribution we can calculate probabilities
- That can help us to investigate trends and differences in our data (EDS 222)

--- 

But first: basic probability theory! 

Intro - The Monte Hall Problem

---

Event, probability, law of large numbers

---

Union, intersection

---

For discrete variables

---

For continuous variables

---

Probability of an exact value for a continuous variable

---

Conditional probability

--- 

A Bayes example
