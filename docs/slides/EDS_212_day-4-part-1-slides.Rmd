## Part 1: Linear algebra continued

- Linear dependence / independence
- Spans (systems of linear equations)
- Using linear algebra in environmental data science

## Vectors as scaled linear combinations of unit vectors

We can write vectors and linear combinations of scaled unit vectors, $\hat{i}$ and $\hat{j}$, which correspond to a vector of length 1 along the x and y axis, respectively. 

So, for example, the vector $\vec{u}=[4,7]$ can also be written as: 

$$\vec{u}=4\hat{i} + 7\hat{j}$$
