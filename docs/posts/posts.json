An .Rmd is created and opened for that post. Note: Youâ€™ll need to knit the blog .Rmd manually (unlike most other docs in your website, which will automatically be rendered when you Build the site).\nIf you want to create blog post drafts, add draft: true to the YAML of the .Rmd for that post.\nYou can also get rid of the blog. Delete the _posts direction in the root, delete the posts folder in docs, and remove the blog information from the _site.yml to disappear it (or, if you want to keep the blog set-up but not have it appear, just remove the blog page from _site.yml).\n\n\n\n",
