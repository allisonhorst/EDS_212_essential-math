## Derivatives by hand

### Find the first derivative of the following functions *the long way*

Use the definition of the derivative: 

$$\frac{df}{dx}=\lim_{\Delta x\to 0}\frac{f(x+\Delta x)-f(x)}{\Delta x}$$

1) $f(x)=3x^2-x+1$

2) $G(t)=4-3t$

### Find the first derivative of the following using rules

3) $f(x) = -3x^5+2x^3-12$

4) $C(z)=4.2z-8.7z^3$

### Find an instantaneous slope

5) A researcher finds that the increase in algal biomass ($B$, in grams) in their aquarium over time ($t$, in hours) follows the function: 

$$B(t) = 0.4 + 0.035t^2$$

- What is the *mass* of algae in tank at 4.5 hours? 

- At what *rate* is biomass increasing in the tank after 10 hours? 

## Derivatives in R with `deriv()` and `D()`

- Create a new R project
- To the project, add an R *script* (discuss how a script differs from R Markdown)
- Add a header (comment out lines with `#` in a script)
- Follow along to find the derivative of several functions using `deriv()` and `D()`

Example: 

```{r}
# Create an expression (right hand side of the equation...):
ex_1 <- expression(5 * x ^ 2)

# Find the derivative with deriv():
my_derivative <- deriv(ex_1, "x")

# Check it out:
my_derivative

# Evaluate it at x = 2.8
x <- 2.8

# Use it! (first returned is function value, second returned is slope)
eval(my_derivative)

```

Alternatively: 
```{r}
# Create an expression:
ex_2 <- expression(3.1 * x ^ 4 - 28 * x)

# Find the derivative with respect to x:
D(ex_2, "x")
```

## More examples with `D()`

### Example: 

```{r}
# Create and store your function
fx <- expression(x^2)

# Find the derivative (with `D()` function):
df_dx <- D(fx, 'x')

# Return the derivative
df_dx

# Find the slope at x = 10:
x <- 10
eval(df_dx)
```

### You try! 

Using the `D()` function in R:

1. Find $\frac{dg}{dx}$ given: $g(z) = 2z^3-10.5z^2+4.1$

2. Find $\frac{dT}{dy}$ given: $T(y) = (2y^3+1)^4-8y^3$

### Solutions: 

$g(z) = 2z^3-10.5z^2+4.1$

```{r}
  gz = expression(2*z^3 - 10.5*z^2 + 4.1)
  dg_dz = D(gz, 'z')
  
  # Return dg_dz
  dg_dz
```

$T(y) = (2y^3+1)^4-8y^3$

```{r}
  ty = expression((2*y^3+1)^4 - 8*y^3)
  dt_dy = D(ty, 'y')
  
  # Return dt_dy
  dt_dy
```

### To find the slope of T(y) at a range of y-values:

We found $\frac{dT}{dy}$ above. What if we want to find the slope at a range of values, instead of just one? 

```{r}

# Create a vector of y values from -0.4 to 2.0, by increments of 0.1
y <- seq(-0.4, 2.0, by = 0.1)

# Evaluate the slope of T(y) at each of those values
eval(dt_dy)
```

## Meet Jupyter Notebooks

- Open the Anaconda Navigator
- Find Jupyter Notebook, click 'Launch'
- Navigate to your current R Project folder
- Click New > Python 3 
- Play around with adding formatted text, code chunks with basic operations, etc. 
- Run code chunks with Shift + Enter

## Hello Python

We're going to be diving into R and Python a *lot* more in EDS 221 - but let's say "Hello" for now by writing a little Python function. 

In Python, the pieces of a function are the same as those in R - we just put them together a bit differently. 

The general structure of a Python function is: 

```{python}
def my_function(a, b):
  calc = a + b
  print(calc)
  
my_function(a = 5, b = 2)
```

What are the similarities between the Python function structure, and a function in R? What would this function look like in R?
