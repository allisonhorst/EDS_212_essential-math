- Derivatives by hand
- Derivatives in R with `D()`
- Meet Jupyter Notebooks
- A Python function

## Derivatives by hand

- 2 derivatives the long way (then you'll never have to do this again)...and tell me what you're doing
- 3 derivatives with rules 
- Find instantaneous slopes from the derivative

## Derivatives in R with `deriv()` and `D()`

- Create a new R project
- To the project, add an R *script* (discuss how a script differs from R Markdown)
- Add a header (comment out lines with `#` in a script)
- Follow along to find the derivative of several functions using `deriv()` and `D()`

Example: 

```{r}
# Create an expression (right hand side of the equation...):
ex_1 <- expression(5 * x ^ 2)

# Find the derivative with deriv():
my_derivative <- deriv(ex_1, "x")

# Check it out:
my_derivative

# Evaluate it at x = 2.8
x <- 2.8

# Use it! (first returned is function value, second returned is slope)
eval(my_derivative)

```

Alternatively: 
```{r}
# Create an expression:
ex_2 <- expression(3.1 * x ^ 4 - 28 * x)

# Find the derivative with respect to x:
D(ex_2, "x")
```

## Meet Jupyter Notebooks

- Open the Anaconda Navigator
- Find Jupyter Notebook, click 'Launch'
- Navigate to your current R Project folder
- Click New > Python 3 
- Play around with adding formatted text, code chunks with basic operations, etc. 
- Run code chunks with Shift + Enter

## Hello Python

We're going to be diving into R and Python a *lot* more in EDS 221 - but let's say "Hello" for now by writing a little Python function. 

In Python, the pieces of a function are the same as those in R - we just put them together a bit differently. 

The general structure of a Python function is: 

```{python}
def my_function(a, b):
  calc = a + b
  print(calc)
  
my_function(a = 5, b = 2)
```

What are the similarities between the Python function structure, and a function in R? What would this function look like in R?
